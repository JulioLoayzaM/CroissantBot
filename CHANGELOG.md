# Changelog

## CroissantBot 1.1.1 (2021-09-22)

Small fix for `version`, better `ping`.

### Patch notes

- fixed: last version's notes were so long, they didn't fit in an Embed's field!
  - fix: Now `version remote` only shows the message before the notes.
  - add: The full notes can be shown with `version notes`.
- changed: the `ping` command now returns the latency.
- changed: the `play_from` and `poggers` command are now hidden.

## CroissantBot 1.1.0 (2021-09-21)

CroissantBot's first minor version update!

Now, the `play` command is all you need to play music, and can even tell the bot to join your voice channel! `yt-dlp` begins to replace `youtube-dl` but since it's a [minor version](https://semver.org/#spec-item-7), backwards compatibility is maintained.

And thanks to Troy Sherlock and SURAJITSHAW for their contributions. :)
