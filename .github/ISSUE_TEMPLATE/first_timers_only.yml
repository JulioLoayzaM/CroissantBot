        Hi! This is a [`first-timers-only`](https://www.firsttimersonly.com/) issue.

        It's aimed towards people who haven't contributed to open source before, or are just starting to.
        As such, it is a relatively simple issue, so newcomers can focus more on the process of contributing rather than the complexity of the issue.

        If that's you, keep reading to find more about the problem, the expected solution, and any proposed steps towards that solution.

        That's it. :)

        I said it is a simple issue, but it can be fairly overwhelming if you don't have much or any experience with `git`, `discord.py`, or even the `asyncio` library.
        Feel free to ask for help at any point, even (or specially) at the beginning.
        Remember, the idea of this issue is to help people get the hang of contributing to projects; the problem itself is just an entertaining mean to that end.

        One last thing: I'd appreciate to have some update on your progress, at most a week after making the claim, even if it's to say you're still working on it.
        That way I can know whether to maintain your assignment or if I should assign it to someone else.
