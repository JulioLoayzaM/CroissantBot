Upgrading to version 2.0.0
==========================

This is the first major update to CroissantBot.
As such, it includes breaking changes, as "small" as deprecating the ``play_from`` command,
to adding new cogs.

Particularly, changes like the ones introduced to ``.env`` (shown in ``.env.example``) may lead to issues.

Since I don't know how many (if any) people use this bot (and want to update it), I'm not actually going to write
this section yet (or at all).

That said, if you:

-  do use this bot,
-  and have reached this page,
-  and have issues with the update;

then I suggest you to `open an issue in the repo <https://github.com/JulioLoayzaM/CroissantBot/issues>`_.
I'll gladly help you sort out the problem(s).
