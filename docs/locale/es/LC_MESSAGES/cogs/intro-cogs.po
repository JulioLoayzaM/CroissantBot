"Cogs are ``discord.py`` classes that allow bot developers to group "
"commands. For example, the code for the music commands can be found in "
"the Music cog. These cogs are loaded when the bot is starting up, which "
"means we could tell CroissantBot what to load."

"Since version 2.0.0, cogs are *not* enabled by default. Instead, you can "
"choose what to use or not, like plugins. This means you don't have to set"
" up cogs you won't use."

"As explained in :ref:`this section <getting_started/bot:intro>`, "
"CroissantBot uses a file called ``.env`` to store the various credentials"
" it uses and its configuration. Particularly, the "
":envvar:`ENABLE_\\<cog\\>` variables are used to determine what cogs "
"should be loaded."

"To enable a cog, uncomment and set the corresponding variable to any "
"`truthy value <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39983695/what-is-"

"Enabling some cogs but not others can lead to some limited "
"functionnality. For example, disabling the Music cog means that you can't"

"All cogs use at least one ``.env`` variable for things ranging from "
"getting API credentials to getting the path to a file they need. So to "
"actually use a cog, you have to set it up. That's where the following "
"guides come in handy."

"Each one explains the packages needed by each cog (in case you didn't "
"install them all already using the ``requirements`` file), so you know "
"which ones you can skip if you're installing them one by one. They also "
"explain what their corresponding ``.env`` variables are and what to set "
"them to."
