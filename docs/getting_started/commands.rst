Commands
========

The lists of all available commands.

When running the bot you can use the ``help`` command to get a list of all available commands *in the
current context*: some commands are guild-only, meaning they can't be
used in DMs (eg. music commands). Others can only be used by the bot's
owner (eg. ``exit`` to stop the bot).
