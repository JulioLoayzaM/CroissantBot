"Cogs are ``discord.py`` classes that allow bot developers to group "
"commands. For example, the code for the music commands can be found in "
"the Music cog. These cogs are loaded when the bot is starting up, which "
"means we can tell CroissantBot what to load."

"Misc cog, as a way to show how to enable them. This way, you can choose "
