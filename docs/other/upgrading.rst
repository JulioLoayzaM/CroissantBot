Upgrading CroissantBot
======================

CroissantBot has had two major updates since its creation.
Following `Semantic Versioning <https://semver.org/>`__,
this means that breaking changes were made: you can find them in the
`Changelog <https://github.com/JulioLoayzaM/CroissantBot/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md>`__.

Particularly, changes like the ones introduced to ``.env`` (shown in ``.env.example``) may lead to issues.
Since I don't know how many (if any) people use this bot (and want to update it),
I'm not going to write this section.

That being said, if you:

-  do use this bot,
-  have reached this page,
-  and have issues with the update,

then I suggest you to
`open an issue in the repo <https://github.com/JulioLoayzaM/CroissantBot/issues>`_.
I'll gladly help you sort out the problem(s).
