Additional info
===============

Some useful tidbits of information.

Keeping the bot online
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to continuously run the bot you can use
:program:`tmux`: `<https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki>`__.

It can create detachable sessions which keep the program running in the background.
A :program:`tmux` session can be reattached to the same or a different terminal or :program:`ssh` session.
